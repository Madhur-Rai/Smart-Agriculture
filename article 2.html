            <h2>What is hydroponic Farming</h2>
            <p>
                Hydroponics is the technique of growing plants using a water-based nutrient solution rather than soil, and can include an aggregate substrate, or growing media, such as vermiculite, coconut coir, or perlite <strong>roots are suspended in the running water chamber and plants takes the nutrients.</strong>
            </p>
            <p><br>
                you can get higher yeild at faster rate it is indoor farming method Plants grown in well-managed hydroponic systems are living the good life. Since roots are bathed in all the nutrients they need, plants spend more time growing upward and less time and energy growing extensive root systems to search for food. 

                Growth rates vary based on the type of system and quality of care, but hydro plants can mature up to 25 percent more quickly than the same plants grown in soil, with increased crop yield, to boot.

            <h2>how does it works</h2>
            <p><br>
             hydroponic systems actually use less water than traditional soil-based systems. This is because closed systems are nt subject to the same rates of evaporation. Plus, the water used in hydroponic systems can be filtered, re-populated with nutrients, and fed back to plants again so that water is constantly being recycled instead of wasted! At Vertical Roots, our systems use up to 98 percent less water than traditional soil-based systems. 

             Other “resources” indoor hydroponic plants dont need? Pesticides and other potentially harmful chemicals, since the hydro crops are protected from many of the pests and plant diseases found outdoors in soil-based farms. </p>

            <h2>Why Should You Use it</h2>
            <p><br> you can grow any crop anywhere just adjusting the atmosphere inside</p>
            </p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>Best part of hydroponic System is that we can <strong>increase the yeild </strong> as in the setup we can<strong> grow leaving almost no gap</strong>>as roots directly take nutrients<strong> from water running beneath them</strong></li>
               <li>Higher growth rates create a <strong>quicker turnover</strong> of your product.</li>
                <li> less area is required and it is indoor farming so there is less chance of losing profit to pests or disease.</li>
                <li>Greater control of nutrient application enables you to consistently <strong>tune crop quality.</strong></li>
                <li>can<strong> grow diverse variety</strong> of crops in any region</li>
                <li>saves upto <strong>98% water </strong>this makes it one of the <strong>most efficient technology</strong></li>
                <li>the same water is reclycled and used again</li>
                </ul>
