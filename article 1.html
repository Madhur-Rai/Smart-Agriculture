            <h2>What is Aeroponic Farming</h2>
            <p>
                Aeroponics is a method of growing plants without soil. Instead, <strong>roots are suspended in the air and irrigated with a nutrient-dense mist.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                In aeroponics, the roots have greater access to oxygen, which results in <strong>healthier plants</strong>, significantly <strong>faster crop growth rates</strong>, and <strong>increased yields.</strong>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="item">

            <h2>how does it works</h2>
            <p><br>
            In this vertical farming method we plant crops in towers known as aeroponic tower in these tower <strong>plants get nutrients from mist and water sparyed.</strong>
            Aeroponic farming commonly uses <strong>nozzles to create mist</strong>. However, technical complexities and issues with maintenance have prevented aeroponics being successful in larger scale agricultural applications, such as greenhouses. </p><p><br>
                we can also <strong>ultrasonic aeroponics</strong>. Ultrasonic technology is used to create high-frequency sound waves that shake water, until it disperses into lots of tiny droplets, like a mist. 

                This removes the need for nozzles and increases the viability of using aeroponics in much larger, commercial growing spaces, where its impact is maximized.</p>

            <h2>Why Should You Use it</h2>
            <p><br>
                Its one of the most Econimical way of farming that can save a lot of money and is safe and harmless to environment and consumers
            </p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>Best part of Aerponic System is that we can <strong>increase the yeild exponentialy</strong> as in vertical tower we can<strong> grow upto 64 crops</strong>> in area of less than<strong> 1 m<sup>2</sup></strong></li>
               <li>Higher growth rates create a <strong>quicker turnover</strong> of your product.</li>
                <li> Because mist is applied only to the root zone, the growing medium remains dry, so there is less chance of losing profit to pests or disease.</li>
                <li>Greater control of nutrient application enables you to consistently <strong>tune crop quality.</strong></li>
                <li>can<strong> grow diverse variety</strong> of crops</li>
                <li>saves upto <strong>95% water </strong>this makes it one of the <strong>most efficient technology</strong></li>
                <li>polutant do not run off to water ways no chance of <strong>euthrophication and pollution</strong></li>
                </ul>

            <h2>material requiered</h2>
            <p><br>
                basic requirement to set up aeroponic farming and increase yeild
            </p><ol style="list-style-type: 1;">
                <li><strong>aeroponic tower </strong>it is a one time investment</li><img src="../../Downloads/a15.jpg" alt="aeroponic tower">
               <li>mist sprayer pump or a ultrasonic sound mist maker <strong>connect it to each towers</strong>,cost upto 500rs</li><img src="../../Downloads/a16.jpg" alt="mist makerr">
                <li>now you are ready to go just plant the crops in each tower about 50 to 60 in each tower and <strong>tune crop quality.</strong></li>
            </ol><p>You can easily get these product either on internet websites or in market place</p>
